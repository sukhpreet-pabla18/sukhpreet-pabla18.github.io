			<p class = "bioParagraph">Kobe Bryant is an American retired professional basketball player and venture capitalist. He was born on August 23, 1978--he's currently 38 years old-- in Philadelphia, PA, to Pam Bryant and Joe Bryant. Joe, a pro basketball player himself, left the NBA and moved his family to Italy when Kobe was six years old. Seven years later, in 1991, they returned to the United States. Kobe attended Lower Merion High School in Philadelphia but decided to spurn college and head straight to the pros at the young age of 17, getting drafted 13th by the Charlotte Hornets but immediately getting traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for center Vlade Divac.

			<p class = "bioParagraph">Kobe Bryant played the shooting guard position in the National Basketball Association for 20 years, all with the Lakers, and won 5 championships as well as countless other accolades and awards. He wore #8 his first 10 years in the league but then changed it to #24 at the start of the 2006-07 season. Recognized as a top 10 player in the history of the NBA, he ended his career on April 13, 2016 in dramatic fashion, scoring 60 points against the Utah Jazz in his very last NBA game ever.</p>
